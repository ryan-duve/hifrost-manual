\section{Nuclear Polarization}
In the presence of a magnetic field, spin-1/2 nuclei tend to align themselves along the axis of the field.  The polarization of the ensemble of particles is defined by 

$$P=\frac{\uparrow-\downarrow}{\uparrow+\downarrow},$$

where ($\downarrow$, $\uparrow$) is the population of nuclei with $m_z$=(-$\nicefrac{1}{2}$,1/2).
