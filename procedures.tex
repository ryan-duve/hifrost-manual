\section{Indium Extrusion}
Hifrost requires indium wire precisely 1 mm in diameter for making MC and IVC seals.  Indium seals must be scraped away after use, and the metal is always recovered (due to its scarcity).  The Indium Association of America charges roughly \$1000 for 13 feet, or about \$20-30 per attempted seal, so it is worth creating our own wire from the so-called ``scraps''.

Indium extrusion is the name of the process that transforms bulk indium into nicely shaped wire.

\subsection{Background} 

Indium scraps or ingots are put into a hollow cylinder with a small hole in the bottom, and the indium is softened with heat and pushed through to make a 1 mm wire.  The melting point of indium is about $150 ^\circ$ C, but approaching this temperature leaves the indium ``runny'' and impossible to shape.  We have found heating the cylinder to $100 ^\circ$ C with a heating tape yields the ideal consistency.

Our first indium die, the plate at the bottom of the hollow cylinder that has a small hole for shaping indium, had a 1 mm hole.  For whatever reason, this produced indium 0.75 mm in diameter (too small for the HiFrost flanges).  We increased the die to 41 mils (about 5\% larger), and the indium wire came out at 1 mm.  

When extruding the indium, a varying force on the hydraulic pump sometimes leads to uneven wire (something like sausage links).  To prevent this, a continuous, non-varying force should be applied for an entire press.

\subsection{Materials}
The \textbf{extrusion cylinder} is an aluminum cylinder with six 1/4-20 bolt holes tapped in the bottom.  The inside of the aluminum is lined with another hollow cylinder made of steel, which precisely matches a \textbf{steel rod} that slides in and out.  If the rod and inner cylinder do not precisely fit, either the rod will not fit in the cylinder or the indium will leak out during the press.  There is a small hole drilled in the side of the aluminum for a thermocouple.

Screwed into the bottom of the extrusion cylinder is the \textbf{indium die}, a plate with a hole through the middle to push indium through.  The entrance hole in top of the die matches in the extrusion cylinder, and the exit hole in the bottom of the die shapes the indium wire.  The die is a separate component from the extrusion cylinder for cleaning and modularity reasons.

\textbf{Indium} is generally recovered from scraps of old seals or ingots are bought from the Indium Association of America (currently a pound costs \$300).  Ingots should be cut with a knife into smaller blocks to fit inside the extrusion cylinder.

The \textbf{extrusion stand} is a mounted, horizontal bar for the hydraulic press to push against so pressure is applied to the extrusion cylinder.  There must also be a hole in the base of the stand for the pressed indium wire to be collected.

A \textbf{thermocouple} sensor is used with an accompanying \textbf{thermocouple readout} to measure the temperature of the extrusion cylinder.

\textbf{Heat tapes} warm the indium so it may be pressed.  The tapes should be long enough to wrap around the cylinder to warm it evenly.

A layer of \textbf{aluminum foil} is wrapped around the heating tapes to keep the heat from dissipating away.

\textbf{Latex and clothe gloves} are for personnel safety and keeping the indium sanitary.

A \textbf{variable alternating current} unit adjusts the temperature of the heating tape.

The indium is extuded onto sterile \textbf{\com{Absorbond Wiper Sheets, TX}} 9\inches x 9\inches, 409, and kept for storage.

An \com{Enerpc} P39 Porta Power \textbf{hydraulic hand pump} provides the force for extrusion.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Prepare electrical connections for heating tape and thermocouple gauge/readout.
\item Remove steel rod from extrusion cylinder and insert blocks of indium.  Place the steel rod back in the cylinder.  \textit{NB: after losses, 100 grams of indium provides approximately 10 feet of wire instead of the theoretical 50 feet.}
\item Wrap the cylinder with heating tape and aluminum foil.
\item Place the cylinder/rod under the extrusion stand.
\item Set the variable current source so the heating tape reaches about $70^\circ$ C, which takes around 20 minutes.  Increase the temperature in steps, allowing the thermocouple to equilibrate between steps, to $100 ^\circ$ C.  \textit{NB: on our VariAC unit the 50 mark corresponds to $75 ^\circ$ C and the 60 mark corresponds to $100^\circ$ C}
\item Set the hydraulic jack on the extrusion cylinder and under the stand's horizontal bar.
\item Use the hand jack to slowly push the indium through the extrusion cylinder and out the die.  The press takes about 5 minutes.  A second person slowly winds the indium wire on the wiper sheets.

\section{Making Indium Seals}

\section{Breaking Indium Seals}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Remove screws with 1.5 mm allen key and the modified MC wrench.  Visually inspect each screw for indium or signs of stripping, and turn each nut back on the screw it came off of.  If there is any torque resistance or sign of stripping, the screw was likely damaged when the indium seal was tightened and both the screw and nut should be discarded.  If there is no damage, return the nuts/screws to the bag labeled ``MC Screws and Nuts''.
\item Use two MC screws and the 1.5 mm allen key as jacking screws the break the indium seal.  Defining the top of the fridge (in the horizontal orientation) as 12:00, the jacking screw holes are at 1:00 and 5:00 look upstream.  The jacking screw holes can be identified by threaded holes in the MC bell housing that have no matching through holes on the fridge MC flange.  Alternate between screws making 1/4 turns until the MC is free.
\item Remove the MC from the fridge, careful not to damage the sensors on the copper dam.
\item Remove the jacking screws from the MC and place in the bag labeled ``MC Screws and Nuts''.
\item Scrape indium, if any, off the MC and place the MC in the safety zone.
\item Scrape indium off the fridge flange, recovering as much as possible in the indium scrap container.  \text{Be very careful not to touch the stainless steel beam window}.
